        <h3> Exra Information</h3>
        <p>I've been publishing fiction books on Amazon since 2018. Writing has 
            always been one of my biggest 
            passions. I am an indie author and through the years, I've worked to 
            gain an audience for my work and worked out the kinks to do so by trial 
            and error. I am the type of person to never give up because I'm persistent
            when it comes to doing what I love. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I live with my sister, her husband, and her two kids (both of which are 
            under two years old). I am a proud auntie and I love to help her out when 
            she needs it.
        </p>
